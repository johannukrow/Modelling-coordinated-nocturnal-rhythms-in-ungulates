# Modelling coordinated nocturnal rhythms in ungulates

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for the paper titled "Modelling coordinated nocturnal rhythms in ungulates". The study focuses on analyzing the nocturnal behavior of ungulates in zoos, with a particular emphasis on the regularity and synchronization of standing-lying cycles.

## Purpose
The code provided in this repository can be used to study and model rhythmic animal behavior according to the methodologies described in the publication. Specifically, it allows for the analysis of (nocturnal) behavior patterns, the identification of regularity in standing-lying cycles (or any other two-phase cycles), and the synchronization of these cycles among multiple animals (such as animals housed together).

## Repository Contents
- `data.csv`: Contains general information about the recorded animals.
- `nights.csv`: Contains detailed information about the behaviour of every recording. 
- `code.py`: Contains the stochastic models and related code.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`
